J1         -  39-28-1243  That is the part number for the straight connector.  However you may find your metal shielding touching your pico this way.
                          It is now recommended if possible to use a right angle connector so you may have better clearance inside the metal PSU shield.  
                          The part number for a right angle connector is PRT-09498

Noctua Fan - 471053-1000

The AC/DC Converter of choice is the EPP-120S-12.  However any 2x3 AC/DC converter can be used.  This specific one has a lot of power to it.

For standoffs for the AC/DC Converter I used M3 screws at 20mm long with matching bolts.  
Plastic standoff part number I used is 9911-12MM

If you're not using a noctua fan when reassembling you can directly solder the fan wires to the motherboard as the 12V and GND should be easy to spot.
